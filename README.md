## Running

This app is tested using Python3 and it needs PyQt5 to be run. If you haven't it installed yet, do that by typing:
```sh
pip3 install PyQt5
```
It also depends on other Python libraries such has Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy, make sure to have those installed before proceeding.

Then type 
```sh
python syRF.pyw
```
