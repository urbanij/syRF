# syRF

<!-- CAD tool to help you design RF and microwave circuits.<br> -->

Check [this webpage](https://urbanij.github.io/syRF/) for an overview.

### Prerequisites


[Python](https://www.python.org/)3 installed on your machine â€“ preferably via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), to make things as smooth as possible. 
This way [other](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/old-pkg-lists/4.3.1/py35/) useful/mandatory packages such as Numpy and Matplotlib will be installed as well.

`PyQt5` i.e. the GUI engine is also mandatory. If not already installed do that by typing

```sh
pip3 install PyQt5
``` 

### Running

Clone/download the repository on your local machine and `cd` into it

then 
```sh
cd src/main/python
```
and finally
```sh
python3 main.py
```
to launch it.

<br>
Alternatively save the file `syRF_launch` (or `syRF_launch.bat` if on Windows), [edit the path](https://github.com/urbanij/syRF/blob/master/syRF_launch#L5), change its permission to executable `chmod +x syRF_launch` and use that to launch the app.
