# syRF

<!-- CAD tool to help you design RF and microwave circuits.<br> -->

Check [this webpage](https://urbanij.github.io/syRF/) for an overview.

### Prerequisites


[Python](https://www.python.org/)3 installed on your machine â€“ preferably via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), to make things as smooth as possible. 
This way [other](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/old-pkg-lists/4.3.1/py35/) useful/mandatory packages such as Numpy and Matplotlib will be installed as well.

`PyQt5` i.e. the GUI engine is also mandatory. If not already installed do that by typing

```sh
pip3 install PyQt5
``` 

### Running

Clone the repository on your local machine 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/urbanij/syRF.git
```
then 
```sh

```
and finally
```sh
python3 syRF.py
```
to launch it.
