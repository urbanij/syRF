                 returns 4 solutions like 
                 this [transmission_line_matching.png],
                 where curves (1) and (3) are transmission lines with 
                 characteristic impedance Z0 and lengths lambda1 
                 and lambda3 respectively,
                 and (2) is a transmission line with characteristic 
                 impedance Z1 (to be calculated) and length Î»/4.
