Code for plotting over the Smith Chart taken from [here](https://github.com/roger-/PyTwoPort/tree/master/twoport).

Disclaimer: I just took the file `smithplot.py` (and his dependencies, i.e. `twoport.py` and `utils.py`) off the repository<sup>1</sup> and used just to plot the stability circles over the pre-existent Smith Chart. 

Thanks to its [author](https://github.com/roger-).
